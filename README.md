# VR_Mini_Project_2
# Multimodal Visual Question Answering with Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a Visual Question Answering (VQA) pipeline using multimodal datasets that combine images and metadata. The goal is to generate and evaluate one-word answer QnA pairs using state-of-the-art models such as **BLIP-VQA-Base**, **BLIP2**, and **ViLBERT**. A custom dataset was curated using the **Gemini API**, and fine-tuning was performed using **LoRA**. The models were evaluated using accuracy and semantic metrics to optimize performance for real-world product understanding tasks.


## Overview
This project involves creating a **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** system using the Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) dataset. The pipeline includes:
- Generating a multiple-choice VQA dataset using multimodal APIs or on-device models.
- Evaluating baseline performance using pre-trained models.
- Fine-tuning selected models with **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**.
- Evaluating model performance using standard and proposed metrics.
- Deploying an inference script for the final trained model.

## Pipeline

### 1. Data Curation

- Multimodal tools such as **Gemini 2.0 API** and on-device models via **Ollama** were explored. Ultimately, **Gemini 2.0 API** was selected for its superior performance in generating relevant Q&A pairs.
- For each image, **3‚Äì7 question-answer pairs** were generated.
- Curated **single-word answer** Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples.  
  *Example:*  
  **Q:** What is the color of the bag?  
  **A:** Red
- Emphasis was placed on **diversity in question types** and **varying difficulty levels**, particularly by leveraging product metadata.
- **Duplicate rows** were removed. Among duplicates, rows with the most complete metadata were retained‚Äîlanguage was not a constraint, as Gemini could convert content into English effectively.
- Careful **prompt engineering** was employed to:
  - Encourage one-word answers
  - Minimize bias toward ‚ÄúTrue/False‚Äù or purely numerical answers
  - Ensure metadata was considered alongside image context for meaningful question generation


### 2. Baseline Evaluation

- Baseline evaluation was performed using the following pre-trained models:
  - **BLIP-2**
  - **BLIP-VQA-BASE**
  - **ViLBERT**
- These models were evaluated **without any fine-tuning** to establish reference performance.
- Metrics recorded include:
  - **Accuracy** and **F1 Score**
  - **BERTScore** for semantic similarity
  - **Ontological similarity** and **Cosine similarity** (useful for one-word answer comparison)
- Baseline inference was run on subsets of the curated test set:
  - Evaluations were done on **100** and **1000** test samples as available in `test.csv` using `evaluation.py`.

### 3. Fine-Tuning with LoRA

- Fine-tuning was performed using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** in combination with **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** and **quantization** techniques to reduce resource requirements.
- Due to **GPU memory** and **compute constraints**, models were trained on smaller subsets of the dataset with fewer epochs.
- An **iterative training approach** was used:
  - Initially trained on a smaller portion of the dataset.
  - Additional samples were used progressively, especially for **BLIP-2**, where memory limitations restricted batch size and sequence length.
- Various **LoRA hyperparameters** were experimented with, including:
  - `r` (rank)
  - `alpha` (scaling factor)
  - `target_modules` (specific layers for LoRA injection)
  - `task_type` (e.g., question answering)
- The best-performing configurations were selected based on a combination of:
  - **Accuracy**, **F1 Score**
  - **BERTScore**
  - **Cosine similarity** and **ontological similarity**
- This fine-tuning allowed better adaptation to the curated QnA data, especially for one-word answers grounded in both **image content** and **metadata context**.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

To measure the performance of models on single-word Visual Question Answering (VQA), we employed both traditional and semantic evaluation metrics.

- **Primary Metrics:**  
  - **Accuracy**: Measures exact match between predicted and ground-truth answers.  
  - **F1 Score**: Useful for imbalanced answer distributions, especially with sparse label spaces.  

- **Additional Metrics:**  
  - **BERTScore** and **BARTScore**: Evaluate the semantic similarity between predicted and actual answers, beneficial for short text like single-word outputs.  
  - **Ontological Similarity**: Measures how semantically close two words are within a knowledge graph (e.g., WordNet).  
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Vector-based semantic similarity between embeddings of predicted and ground truth answers.

#### Performance Comparison: Before vs After Fine-Tuning (LoRA)

| Model              | Stage             | Accuracy | F1 Score | BERTScore | Cosine Sim. |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **BLIP-VQA-Base**  | Before Fine-Tuning| 34%      | 0.16     | 0.850      | 0.633        |
|                    | After LoRA FT     | 54%      | 0.31     | 0.960      | 0.736        |
| **BLIP2-Flan-T5**  | Before Fine-Tuning| 20%      | 0.09     | 0.779      | 0.490        |
|                    | After LoRA FT     | 49%      | 0.275    | 0.870      | 0.721        |
| **ViLBERT**        | Before Fine-Tuning| 18%      | 0.06     | 0.855      | 0.510        |
|                    | After LoRA FT     | 51%      | 0.298    | 0.910      | 0.728        |

---

#### Key Observations:

- **BLIP-VQA-Base** emerged as the most balanced and effective model post fine-tuning. It achieved the **highest accuracy and semantic similarity scores**, making it the preferred choice for the final inference stage.
  
- **BLIP2-Flan-T5** is a **large generative model**, originally designed to produce complete sentences. While it‚Äôs powerful, its tendency to generate verbose responses (e.g., full phrases instead of single-word answers) led to **lower accuracy and F1**, despite moderate semantic similarity scores. It improved with prompt engineering and LoRA-based tuning.

- **ViLBERT**, though older, demonstrated strong label-focused prediction behavior post fine-tuning. Its performance improved significantly when fine-tuned, especially in BERTScore and cosine similarity, indicating its capability to learn concise and context-aware responses.

> üîç **Note:** Fine-tuning was done using **LoRA**, **PEFT**, and **quantization**, and was adapted to memory-constrained environments by iteratively training on smaller curated datasets with single-word answers.

### 5. Iterative Improvement

- **Continuous refinement** of both the dataset and fine-tuning strategy was done based on feedback from evaluation metrics (Accuracy, BERTScore, Cosine similarity, etc.).
- Prompt engineering and metadata usage were revised to improve the **quality and diversity of generated QnA pairs**.
- Fine-tuning parameters in LoRA were **adjusted across iterations**, using smaller data batches to monitor incremental gains without overfitting.
- Observations from **baseline vs. fine-tuned model performance** guided decisions on data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and layer targeting.
- The goal was to **maximize performance on evaluation metrics** and ensure generalizability before final submission and deployment.

--- 

## Future Improvements  

- **Joint Multimodal Curation**: Currently, question-answer pairs are primarily generated from metadata. Future work should emphasize joint use of both **image features and metadata** for more diverse and visually grounded questions.

- **Larger-Scale Training**: Fine-tuning was done with limited data and compute. With access to **larger datasets** and **longer training schedules**, especially with LoRA or full fine-tuning, performance can be significantly enhanced.

- **Better Prompt Engineering for Generative Models**: Especially for BLIP2, improved prompt design can guide the model toward **more concise, one-word outputs** instead of full sentences.

- **Hard Negative Sampling**: Incorporating harder or semantically similar distractors in the training set can help models **better distinguish subtle visual cues**.

- **Evaluation with Human Judgement**: Complement automated metrics with **human evaluation** to assess answer appropriateness, especially for ambiguous or subjective questions.

- **Ensemble of Models**: Combine outputs from multiple models (e.g., BLIP2 + BLIP-VQA) to leverage **both generative and classification-style answering**.

- **Task-Specific Adapters**: Explore **vision-language adapters or task-specific heads** that specialize in single-word classification from image-question pairs.

- **Error Analysis & Bias Mitigation**: Conduct systematic error analysis to identify common failure patterns (e.g., color confusion, language bias) and improve robustness.

AIM825 Course Project: Multimodal Visual Question Answering with Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset
Overview
This repository contains the code, dataset, and documentation for the AIM825 Course Project at IIITB, developed by Harsh Dhruv (IMT2022008), Rudra Pathak (IMT2022081), and Aditya Saraf (IMT2022067). The project focuses on building a Multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) system using the Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) dataset. We curated a dataset of approximately 100,000 single-word answer question-answer pairs, evaluated pre-trained models, fine-tuned BLIP-VQA-Base, BLIP-2 (Flan-T5-XL), and Vilbert using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and assessed performance with metrics like Exact Match Accuracy, F1 Score, BERTScore, BARTScore, Cosine Similarity, and Ontological Similarity. The project was constrained to free cloud GPUs (Kaggle) and models with up to 7 billion parameters.
